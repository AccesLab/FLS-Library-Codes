# FLS-Library-Codes
This project is developed at North Carolina A&T State University, ACCESS LAB. The aim of this project is to create a fuzzy logic system library that can assist real time fuzzy logic control application developers.
The library helps to perform fuzzification, inference and defuzzification operations for all inputs according to the defined rules and 
configuration. Please site the work if you use it for any of your projects.
